Libraries create community
Most libraries are more than just places for borrowing books - they're also places for people to gather and share ideas, find mentors or experts from other fields, take classes or workshops, network or collaborate on projects. In this way, libraries help to create meaningful relationships, promote industry collaboration and build stronger communities.
